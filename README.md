# 🍷 Wine Quality EDA

This project explores the physicochemical properties of red wine and how they relate to its quality score. Using Python-based EDA techniques, the notebook analyzes trends, distributions, and correlations within the dataset to better understand what makes a wine high or low quality.

The analysis includes visual exploration of features like alcohol, acidity, sulphates, and pH, with statistical summaries and pattern observations. The project uses Seaborn and Matplotlib for clear, insightful plots and Pandas for efficient data manipulation.
